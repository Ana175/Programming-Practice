<p id="1">a. Below is the list of the programs that enables you to enhance your knowledge about loops(for/while) and conditional statements(if-else/switch).</p>
<span>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		1. Write a program that prints a fibonaci series that is a sequence of numbers like0 1 1 2 3 5 8.You can vary the number of elements to be printed meaning you can print 10 numbers or 15 or 20 or any desired number.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		2. Write a program print "ping" if a number is divisible by 3,"pong" if a number is divisible by 5, and "ping pong" if number is divisible by both, else print the number.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		3. Write a program that swaps 2 given numbers. You need to have 2 separate functions in the program.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    		 --> One Function should swap the numbers without any third new variable.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      		 --> Second function should swap the numbers using a third variable.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    	4. Write a program  to calculate factorial of a given number. You need to compute the factorial with one logic that uses recursion and another logic without recursion.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   	    5. Write a program  to check if a given number is prime or not.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   	    6. Write a program  to check an armstrong number i.e. whether the if we power up the each individual number to the total number of digits in the number and add them it should be equal to the number itself. For example 153 has 3 digits in it and if we do 1^3+5^3+3^3=153.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   		   FYI: ^ means is to the power.</br>
